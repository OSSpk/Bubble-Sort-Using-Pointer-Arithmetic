# Bubble Sort Using Pointers

Bubble Sort is implemented keeping the following requirements in mind:

*	Use pointers to scan/traverse the array. Any loop iterating from index zero to size (i.e. using integer counters to traverse the array) is not allowed.
*	You cannot use subscript operator [] in your program.
